Project Proposal: Spotify Music Swipe App
Project Title: SwipeSound- Personalized Music Discovery and Playlist Creation App
Project Overview:
SwipeSound is a web application designed to revolutionize how users discover music. By
combining the interactive "swipe" feature popularized by dating apps with Spotify’s robust music
catalog, SwipeSound offers a personalized music discovery experience. The app will recommend
songs based on a user’s listening habits and preferences, allow users to swipe left (dislike) or
right (like) on song previews, and automatically curate a Spotify playlist with liked songs.
Integrated AI algorithms will continuously learn and adapt to the user’s music taste, enhancing
recommendations over time.
Project Goals:
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Create a seamless user interface for swiping through song previews
Integrate Spotify API to fetch song previews and manage playlists
Implement the use of AI algorithms to personalize music recommendations based on user
behavior
Build a Spotify-connected playlist that auto-updates with liked songs
Provide an engaging and intuitive user experience with minimal friction
